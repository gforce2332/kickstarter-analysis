## General Info 
- Used concepts of outliers to better plan campaign strategies.
- Determined how other campaigns did reaching their funding goals.
- Determined goal outcomes and theater outcomes based on launch date.
- Analysis will create insights into which campaigns were successful vs which ones failed helping to set up and plan a new campaign for success.

## Analysis and Challenges
The goal was to ascertain how different campaigns fared in correlation to their launch dates and funding goals. Through a process of using formulas to clean dates and transform data into useful categories, filtering techniques were then used to sort the data into relevant tables. Potential challenges could have been the amount of data collected or data collected from multiple sources.

## Results
* Theater campaigns had a higher success rate with a launch date during the months of May, June and July.
* A launch date in December had the lowest rate of success. 
* The large funding goals had a higher probability for failure than those in the lower range.
* It is difficult to draw a conclusion why these campaigns were more or less successful without more data or to determine why a $40000 campaign might be more successful than a $25000 campaign when the highest funding goals had a lower success rate.
* A standard chart or bar graph could also have been used.
